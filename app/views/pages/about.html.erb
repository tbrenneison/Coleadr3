<h4>CoLeadr is a web app meant to help leaders of small organizations better manage their membership data, scheduling, and planning process.</h4>
<p>It was originally designed as a response to a new Girl Scout leader asking for troop management software recommendations.  The troop he managed was brand new, and did not have the budget to buy a program-specific, licensed software package.  <strong>CoLeadr is meant to be a generic solution to help leaders of any small group</strong>, be it a scout troop, church comittee, or recreational sports team.  It is being developed by Tori Brenneison, a former Girl Scout leader, and is designed to be easy to set up and even easier to use.</p>
<p>Version 0.2 was made during Tori's time at We Can Code IT programming bootcamp while she turned her hobby into a full-time career.  Now, <strong>version 0.3 is being developed and hopefully will be available to a limited group of users starting in July of 2016, if not earlier.  The goal is to release CoLeadr v.1 to the public in September 2016</strong>.</p>
<p>Since CoLeadr's original inspiration was a Girl Scout troop leader with no budget for software, <strong>the most basic version of CoLeadr will always be availabe for free</strong>.  Plans for monetization include adding functionality and options onto the app that will only be available to users with paid accounts, but the goal is to keep premium versions of CoLeadr affordable.  Basic CoLeadr accounts will come with two user logins, member information, event scheduling, and project tracking functionality.  Plans for premium accounts include more logins, the ability to collect money and track finances, and the ability to send email from within Coleadr.</p>
